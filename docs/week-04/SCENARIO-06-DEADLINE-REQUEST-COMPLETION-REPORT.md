Fixed Deadline classification logged with full rationale. Key assessment: request is AMBIGUOUS - cannot commit until scope clarified. Risk of over-promise if starting immediately. Critical unknowns documented (7 items): time period, campus scope, program scope, data fields, format, breakdown definition, and approval authority.

## Part 3: Reflection & Learning

### What I Learned

#### 1. Fixed Deadline vs Other Classes of Service
- **Time-driven, not user-count-driven:** A single Director request can be Fixed Deadline if the deadline is hard and business impact is high
- **Success metric is delivery time:** Not just "resolved", but "delivered with enough buffer for the customer to review"
- **Buffer is mandatory:** Committing to 6:00 PM for a 9:00 AM meeting gives 15 hours of review time - this is intentional, not a coincidence

#### 2. Clarify Before Committing
- **Scope ambiguity is the #1 risk:** Starting immediately on an unclear request wastes time and risks delivering the wrong thing
- **6 questions asked upfront:** Time period, campus scope, program scope, data fields, format, breakdown definition - all critical
- **ACK can include questions:** The acknowledgement email does not have to just confirm receipt - it can request the information needed to proceed
- **Director responded in 3 minutes:** The call option offered in the ACK was a good fallback, but written response came fast

#### 3. MVP + Nice-to-Have Proposal Structure
- **Separate what is guaranteed from what is best-effort:** Director understood clearly what they would definitely receive vs what might be included
- **Never include enhancements in the committed timeline:** If trend comparison and top 5 took longer than expected, core delivery would not be at risk
- **Result:** Both enhancements were completed anyway - but if they had not been, the commitment was still met

#### 4. Data Access Approval Workflow
- **PII and data permissions must be handled proactively:** Requesting approval BEFORE starting data extraction prevented a blocking issue mid-execution
- **Include specific conditions:** No PII export, aggregate only, delete after delivery - documented clearly in the approval request
- **Approval as a dependency, not an afterthought:** Built into the timeline from the beginning

#### 5. Progress Updates Build Trust
- **Day 1 end-of-day update:** Director knew work was on track before going to sleep
- **Day 2 2:00 PM update:** Director had visibility into completion status 4 hours before delivery
- **Proactive communication reduces anxiety:** With a hard deadline for a Director meeting, silence creates worry

---

### Challenges Encountered

#### Challenge 1: Ambiguous Scope with Time Pressure
**Issue:** Request had both a hard deadline AND unclear requirements - the temptation was to start immediately to save time

**How I solved it:**
- Sent clarifying questions in the ACK email itself (no extra round trip)
- Offered a 15-minute call as a faster alternative
- Set a response deadline (before 11:00 PM) so the team could still start that night
- Director responded in time, no delay to execution

#### Challenge 2: Data Access as a Blocking Dependency
**Issue:** Without VP/Manager approval, data extraction could not begin - and this approval takes time

**How I solved it:**
- Requested data access approval in parallel with sending the scope confirmation to Director
- Documented specific access needed (read-only, no PII, aggregate only) to make approval fast
- Built approval wait time into the timeline buffer
- Both approvals received within minutes of each other

#### Challenge 3: Setting a Delivery Time Earlier Than the Deadline
**Issue:** Deadline was 09:00 AM Day 3, but committing to deliver at that exact time leaves no review time

**How I solved it:**
- Committed to deliver at 6:00 PM Day 2 - 15 hours before meeting
- Explained to Director that early delivery allows review and adjustment time
- Actual delivery was exactly at 6:00 PM Day 2 as committed
- Director had until 8:00 AM Day 3 to request changes if needed

---

### Final Thoughts

Scenario 06 demonstrated the most complex class of service - Fixed Deadline - where the pressure of a hard deadline creates the strongest temptation to act before thinking. The key discipline learned is that **taking 10 minutes to ask 6 clarifying questions saves hours of rework and prevents the worst outcome: delivering the right report too late, or the wrong report on time.**

The most valuable lesson learned is that **a Fixed Deadline request requires a structured response, not a rushed one.** Clarify scope, propose an MVP, get approvals, execute with regular updates, and deliver with buffer. The Director received a report that was ready 15 hours before the meeting - not because the team worked faster, but because the process was structured correctly from the first minute.
